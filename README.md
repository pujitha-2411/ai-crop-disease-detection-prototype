Overview

Crop diseases reduce agricultural productivity and farmer income. This project presents a UI prototype that demonstrates how an AI-based system can help identify crop diseases from leaf images and suggest treatment steps.

Solution

The prototype allows users to upload a crop leaf image and view a simulated disease prediction with recommended cures. It demonstrates the workflow of an AI system using CNN-based image classification (conceptual), without backend or model integration.

SDG Alignment
